## About the Project

This project demonstrates the accessibility of modern TinyML through a complete, end-to-end workflow. At its core is a custom-trained image classification model that runs entirely on-deviceâ€”making it fast, private, and reliable without needing an internet connection.

The repository covers the full process: collecting data, training a model, and deploying it. Using platforms like Edge Impulse, building and deploying machine learning models at the edge is now approachable for anyone, not just experts.
